/*
The list of cities and their direct distances are given in a 2D array. For example

distances = [
  [0, 3, 2, -1]
  [3, 0, -1, 5],
  [2, -1, 0, 9]
  [-1, 5, 9, 0]
]
Explanation: the value at cell [i, j] represents the distance between city i and city j. The distance between a city and itself is zero (i.e., [i, i] = 0 for every i). If there is no direct path between city i and j, then [i, j] = -1.

Implement a program to calculate the shortest path's length from the first city (index 0) to the last city (index n - 1, n is the number of cities).

In the above example, there are 2 paths from city 0 to city 3

0 -> 1 -> 3 (length 3 + length 5 = 8)

0 -> 2 -> 3 (length 2 + length 9 = 11)

So, the shortest path is: 0 -> 1 -> 3

Note: all valid paths have distance > 0
